              <b> Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko</b>, also known as ‘Kobzar
              Taras’, or simply Kobzar , was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist,
              public and political figure, folklorist and ethnographer. His
              literary heritage is regarded to be the foundation of modern
              Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian
              language though it is different from the language of his poems.
              Shevchenko is also known for his many masterpieces as a painter
              and an illustrator.

              <b>Ratusha</b>, Ivano-Frankivsk is a several stories-tall building
              in the downtown (Old Town) of the city of Ivano-Frankivsk which
              formerly served as the town hall (Rathaus in German and ratusz in
              Polish, hence the name) and now houses the Ivano-Frankivsk
              Regional History, Crafts and Culture Museum and an observation
              deck. It is located in the center, at the city's Market Square.<br /><br />
              It is the only town hall in Ukraine built in the Art Deco style
              (part of the Modern Style). The current design was created in the
              1920s by Polish architect Stanisław Trela, while the original
              building was built when the city was founded, in the 17th century.
              The building is constructed such that from a top view it is
              reminiscent of the Polish order of Virtuti Militari (Military
              Valor).
