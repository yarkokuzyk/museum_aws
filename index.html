				<b> Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko</b>, also known as ‘Kobzar Taras’, or simply Kobzar , was a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, public and political figure, folklorist and ethnographer. His literary heritage is regarded to be the foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, to a large extent, the modern Ukrainian language though it is different from the language of his poems. Shevchenko is also known for his many masterpieces as a painter and an illustrator.
