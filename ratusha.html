                The current town hall in Ivano-Frankivsk is not the first in the history of the city. They began to work in 1929, and finished in 1935 (internal work was completed in 1939). The author of the project is architect Stanislav Trelya. The town hall looked like nothing else - cross-like in terms of life from four double-topped wings, crowned with a tower, yak became the tall dominant of the city - its height reached 49 and a half meters. The completion of the bashti was broken up near the Veletensky Viysk sholom, and on the fourth level, Polish eagles were placed on top - a symbol of the oppression of that state.

            <p>In 1871 the third town hall was built in Stanislav. This beautiful building was badly damaged in 1915 during the battles for the city and stood for a long time half-destroyed. It was later dismantled. The current town hall is the fourth in the city, which from its foundation until 1918 was called Stanislav, until 1939 - Stanislav, then again Stanislav, and since 1962 it is called Ivano-Frankivsk.</p>
