        <p> The Museum of the Heavenly Hundred in Ivano-Frankivsk was opened on September 11, 2015. Almost a year after the events on the Maidan ended. Nothing here is still called an artifact or an exhibit. Just a memory of the Heroes who died during the Revolution of Dignity. And there are more than 800 such "things of memory" here.

                Among them are personal belongings of Maidan residents, their portraits, as well as paintings and installations that visually return people to those events. Their author is the Ivano-Frankivsk artist Roman Bonchuk, who came up with the idea of creating this Museum of the Heavenly Hundred.

            <p> “All the paintings I saw on the Maidan still do not let me go, they keep me… The memory of the artist captures emotions, and there were many of them then. This is excitement, sleepless nights, and rethinking - what will happen next, what awaits us ... I often came by car to the Maidan, made sketches there, talked to people, brought them help. It was a constant movement and an understanding that what is happening and happening here should be a reflection of creativity, and it is my duty. I remember when I often visited and talked to Lubomir Husar. These were talks about Ukraine, about the Maidan, about humanity. It is possible that the spiritualization I received from His Beatitude caused me to simply "explode" the Maidan works. Then I created more than a thousand paintings, "recalls Roman Bonchuk.
